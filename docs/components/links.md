title: Links
---

Users need links to navigate from one page to another. They have four possible styles that indicate their state (hover, active, focus and visited) .

The text used in a link should be descriptive of the page itâ€™s taking the user to.

## Link example

<div class="component-example">
  <div class="component-example__content">
    <a class="sk-a sk-blue sk-pointer sk-text-align-left">
      Find out more about dogs
    </a>
  </div>
</div>

```
<a class="sk-a">
  Find out more about dogs
</a>
```
